# Food-and-Calorie-Detector
It is food and calorie detector in this if detector when the user shows any food item on the webcam the detector would detect and idenitfy whether the food is healthy or unhealthy.
This detector has a ML-Model behind it which was trained by me by giving/feeding various healthy and unhealthy images to the model to train it so as it could identify.
